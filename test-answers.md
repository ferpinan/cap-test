__A__

List has bean used so we could use streams to find the first bigger element in a sublist.
Set was discarded because it can not contain duplcated elements.

__B__ 

The complexity is O(n+n-1+n-2....n times).

To solve this complexity, we need to use Sum for mathematics formula by see this link

    => n+n+n...n times - (1+2+3...n times)
    => n^2- (n^2+n)/2

Complexity will be

__`O((n^2-n)/2)`__
